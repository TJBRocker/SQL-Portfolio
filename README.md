# Tom's SQL Portfolio!
***

After reading countless Reddit threads, job ads, youtube videos etc... I decided that SQL was a key place to start with my data journey!

I started my initial journey via the SQL journey path on [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/), before then working through the excellent [SQL for Data Scientist](https://sqlfordatascientists.com/) by Ren√©e Teate. I've also dabbled with a few youtube courses by the notable [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/alextheanalyst)

Through these study methods I've found myself using SQLite, MySQL and MS SQL Server, learning a number of different techniques and functions notably:

- Aggregate functions
- Joins
- CASE statements
- CTEs
- Window functions
- Subqueries
- Date functions
- Data cleaning
- and much more!

According to [Nick Singh](linkedin.com/in/nick-singh-tech/) this is a real PayPal interview coding assignment. After completing various challenges and tutorials I found this realtively straightforward, but check out my solution at the following [LINK](https://github.com/TJBRocker/SQL-Portfolio/tree/main/Braintree%20Data%20Analyst%20Challenge)

## Dataquest Northwind Traders

## 8 Week SQL challenge
***

Following numerous data gurus on all platforms led me to [Danny Ma's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny) SQL challenge, the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)

There are eight different case studies over the entire challenge, which I'm going to update my process as I get along saved [HERE](https://github.com/TJBRocker/SQL-Portfolio/tree/main/8%20Week%20SQL%20Challenge)
