# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This is my first experiment into the world of Github and creating a portfolio!

I've been practising SQL a while through different courses and books and this is my initial step into the unknown.

The full challenge can be found [HERE](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), but essentially is broken into a number of different scenarios with varied level of difficulty within each of the challenges.

[MY SOLUTION[(https://github.com/TJBRocker/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/8%20Week%20SQL%20Challenge/Case%20Study%20%231%20-%20Danny's%20Diner/Solution.md)

### Task
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

### Task

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

### Task
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Case Study #4 - Data Bank:

### Task

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

### Task

Data Mart is Danny’s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyse his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it’s separate business areas.

The key business question he wants you to help him answer are the following:

- What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
- Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
- What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?
