# Case Study #5 - Data Mart

## 1. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `cleaned_weekly_sales`
- Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format

- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column

- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original `segment` column using the following mapping on the number inside the `segment` value

|segment|age_band|
|----|----|
|1|Young Adults|
|2|Middle Aged|
|3 or 4|Retirees|

- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:

|segment|demographic|
|----|----|
|C|	Couples|
|F	|Families|

- Ensure all `null` string values with an `"unknown"` string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns

- Generate a `new avg_transaction` column as the `sales` value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
